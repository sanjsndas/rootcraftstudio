<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
<p>This Cookie Policy explains how RootCraft Studio ("we", "our", or "us") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at rootcraftstudio.com. It explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control their usage. This comprehensive policy contains detailed information separated into 40 points for full transparency.</p>

<h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.

<p>We use different types of cookies on our website including essential cookies that enable core site functionality; performance cookies that collect anonymous data to improve user experience; functionality cookies that remember your settings; and advertising cookies to tailor relevant marketing communications.</p>

<h2>3. First-Party vs. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
<p>First-party cookies are set by the RootCraft Studio website, while third-party cookies may be set by service providers like analytics or advertising partners. We ensure third parties comply with privacy standards and that their use of cookies is disclosed transparently to you.</p>

<h2>4. How We Use Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies help us recognize repeat visitors, understand user behavior, remember preferences such as language and region, enable shopping carts, and deliver personalized content. They also assist us in measuring the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and optimizing website performance.</p>

<h2>5. Essential Cookies</h2>
<p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly, allowing you to navigate pages, log in securely, and use site features. Without essential cookies, services like secure transactions or login may not work correctly.</p>

<h2>6. Performance and Analytics Cookies</h2>
<p>These cookies collect anonymous information about how visitors use our website, such as which pages are visited most often and error messages. This helps us improve our site’s functionality and your overall experience by identifying areas that need enhancement.</p>

<h2>7. Functionality Cookies</h2>
<p>Functionality cookies allow the website to remember choices you have made in the past, such as your username, language preferences, or region. These improve your personalized experience and make using the site more convenient each time you visit.</p>

<h2>8. Marketing and Advertising Cookies</h2>
<p>We use these cookies to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They may also limit how many times you see an ad and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</p>

<h2>9. Cookie Lifespans</h2>
<p>Different cookies have differing lifespans: session cookies are temporary and deleted when you close your browser; persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period or until manually deleted. Our policies depend on the type of cookie used.</p>

<h2>10. Consent to Cookies</h2>
<p>We require your explicit consent to use non-essential cookies such as performance, functionality, and advertising cookies. You may accept or decline cookies through the cookie consent dialog. Your choices will be saved and respected during future visits.</p>

<h2>11. Managing Cookie Preferences</h2>
<p>You can manage or disable cookies using your browser settings or preferences at any time. We provide clear guidance on how to do this within this policy. Note that disabling cookies may affect website usability and your user experience.</p>

<h2>12. How to Disable Cookies in Different Browsers</h2>
<p>Instructions for managing cookies vary by browser. For example, in Chrome: go to settings → privacy and security → cookies and other site data; in Firefox: options → privacy & security → cookies and site data. We encourage reviewing your browser’s help section for precise controls.</p>

<h2>13. Cookie Consent Dialog</h2>
<p>Our cookie consent dialog appears at the bottom of your first visit. It explains our use of cookies and gives the option to accept or decline. Managing cookies is easy, and consenting helps us improve the site. You can revisit this choice anytime.</p>

<h2>14. Withdrawal of Consent</h2>
<p>You can withdraw or change your cookie preferences at any time from the cookie settings link provided in the footer of our website. This action is immediate and does not affect the lawfulness of prior data processing.</p>

<h2>15. Cookies from Third Parties</h2>
<p>Some services embedded into our site, such as social media platforms or analytics tools, may set their own cookies. We have no control over these cookies but require that third parties comply with privacy laws and disclose their practices.</p>

<h2>16. Analytics Providers</h2>
<p>We use Google Analytics and other analytics providers to collect aggregate and anonymous data. These providers use cookies to track visitor interactions and generate reports to help us understand usage patterns and improve our service.</p>

<h2>17. Advertising Partners</h2>
<p>Our advertising partners may use cookies to display relevant advertisements to you on our site and other sites on the internet. These cookies enable the delivery of targeted ads based on your visit to our website.</p>

<h2>23. Persistent Cookies Role</h2>
<p>Persistent cookies remain on your device for a fixed time and remember settings or login information. They enable you to return to the website without re-entering information, enhancing usability and convenience.</p>

<h2>24. Social Media Cookies</h2>
<p>Our website includes social media sharing buttons that may set cookies to track visitors across websites. These are managed by the social platforms and subject to their privacy policies, not ours.</p>
